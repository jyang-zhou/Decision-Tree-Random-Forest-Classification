# Decision-Tree-Random-Forest-Classification

A decision tree is a supervised machine learning algorithm that can be used for both classification and regression problems.

Random Forest is a tree-based machine learning algorithm that leverages the power of multiple decision trees for making decisions.

# Dataset

The dataset consists of 400 rows and 3 features, including Age, EstimatedSalary, and Purchased. Here, the target variable is Purchased, which indicates whether a person purchased the item or not.
